A set of [tinted-theming](https://github.com/tinted-theming/home) (base16) templates for the TUI file manager [Yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi). It generates yazi's [flavors](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/flavors/overview/) from base16 schemes.

## Usage

To use this, copy one or more theme in this repo's flavors directories (e.g., base16-default-dark.yazi) into the `flavors` directory within your yazi's config directories.  Then put it as a flavor in your `theme.yazi` file.
